What if the success you’ve been chasing… was never really yours?
​You set the goal. You hit the milestone. But days later — you feel the same. Unfulfilled. Unsatisfied. Still searching. How many times have you achieved something only to feel emptier than before? That’s not failure. That’s the result of chasing someone else’s idea of success.

​This meditation isn’t about more hustle, bigger goals, or external validation.
​It’s about coming home to the version of success that’s true to you. 
A definition built not on pressure, perfection, or productivity — but on purpose, peace, and presence. 
What if success wasn’t something to push for — but something to calibrate? Join me, your host Anna Kitney and special guest Sabinije von Gaffke for a powerful exploration of leadership, coherence, and sustainable success. 
Sabinije von Gaffke works with a simple but profound question: How do we succeed, lead, and evolve without abandoning ourselves along the way? 
Sabinije will guide participants through CALIBRATION™️ — her newly introduced framework for redefining success through coherence, embodiment, and sustainable leadership, offering both conceptual insight and an embodied experience. 
​Anna will guide you through the SoulAlign® Heal method to: 
​✅ Let go of outdated versions of success that leave you spinning
✅ Tune into your own soul values, not society’s expectations
✅ Clarify what fulfilment truly feels like in your body and nervous system
✅ Activate a peaceful, grounded inner state you can return to daily
✅ Anchor a new success standard — one that lasts 
​You’ll Walk Away With: 


​A personal, soul-aligned definition of success that finally feels like yours — not what the world told you it should be.
No more chasing. No more performing. Just deep clarity on what truly matters to you. 


​A body-reset that releases the pressure of constant achievement.
You’ll experience what success feels like when it’s calm, grounded, and sustainable. 


​Clarity around the goals, timelines, and expectations you’re ready to let go of — and the ones that are truly aligned.
You’ll leave knowing what to stop striving for, and what to start honouring. You’ll create goals with soul. 


​An embodied sense of fulfilment you can access anytime — without needing to “achieve” anything.
Success becomes a state, not a finish line. 


​A renewed connection to purpose, peace, and presence — so your next chapter is built on truth, not templates.
This becomes your new foundation for business, relationships, and life. 


​Why This Event Matters
​We’ve all been taught that success is a destination:
The money. The milestone. The title. The house. 
​But true success — the kind that lasts — is an internal state. 
​It comes from alignment to your most important values.
From a deeper and heartfelt meaning.
From a feeling of being on path with your divine purpose. 
​This live meditation experience is your moment to reclaim that path — and step back into your own rhythm. 
​You don’t need to chase success. 
​You only need to remember what it means to you. 
​Join us for a powerful morning of reflection, recalibration, and redefinition — so you can create from a place of fulfilment, not pressure. 
​You’ll leave not just clearer — but lighter, more grounded, and fully connected to what matters most.
