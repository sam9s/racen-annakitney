**About this event:**

9-11TH JANUARY 2026 | A 3-Part Challenge With Anna Kitney for Soul-Led Entrepreneurs
Manifest Consistently. Expand Effortlessly. Lead From Overflow.
Rewire Your Financial Thermostat, Dissolve Subconscious Limitations, and Finally Claim the Income Level Your Soul Has Always Known Was Yours
Why You’re Still Feeling “Stuck” (even after all the healing)

You’re not stuck because you haven’t done enough. You’re stuck because part of you still believes you need to keep earning it.
You’ve done the trauma work. You’ve cleared ancestral money blocks. But if you’re still subconsciously equating healing with worthiness… you’re reinforcing a paradigm where wealth only comes after the work is done.
And so?

You keep healing.You keep fixing.You keep releasing.And unconsciously… you delay receiving.

Meanwhile, there are people making millions not because they’re more spiritual or smarter—but because they’ve anchored into energetic entitlement.They don’t question their right to receive. They just receive. Period.

*REGISTER NOW*


*DAY 1: THE WOMAN WHO DECIDES*

Command Reality, Don’t Chase It
→ You’ll architect the energetic blueprint of your next-level reality—not based on safety or logic, but on certainty.
You’ll stop trying to align with your desires and instead align your field so hard your desires have no choice but to respond.
Core Activation:

Radically redefine overflow in your terms—pleasure, wealth, intimacy, power.

Collapse survival-based goals you didn’t consent to.

Stop waiting for proof. Decide it’s already done.

🜂 VIP Bonus: SoulVision Map™ Foundation + Daily Giveaway

*DAY 2: THE IDENTITY COLLAPSE*

You’re Not Becoming Her. You Already Are.
→ You’ll collapse the “in-between” you’ve been stuck in: the version of you who keeps preparing, tweaking, affirming.
We will recode the identity matrix and remove the part of you still asking: “Am I allowed to be her yet?”
Core Activation:

Shift into your God Frequency using the 3-part Identity Recalibration Sequence™

Rewrite your self-concept at the ROOT—not just mindset, but field-level

Experience embodiment of “I AM the overflow. I don’t attract it—I broadcast it.”

🜂 Bonus: Daily Giveaway


*DAY 3: THE GODZONE LOCK-IN*

Overflow Becomes the New Default.
→ You stop creating for results and start creating for joy.Your field becomes your strategy. Your presence becomes your power.
Core Activation:

Lock in new standards, decisions, and embodied rituals from your 4th-level consciousness.

Collapse time between decision and manifestation.

End the performance. Begin the reign.

🜂 Integration Ceremony + Giveaway + Invitation to continue the expansion

**About this event:**

What if the success you’ve been chasing… was never really yours?
​You set the goal. You hit the milestone. But days later — you feel the same. Unfulfilled. Unsatisfied. Still searching. How many times have you achieved something only to feel emptier than before? That’s not failure. That’s the result of chasing someone else’s idea of success.
Get Tickets
​This meditation isn’t about more hustle, bigger goals, or external validation.
​It’s about coming home to the version of success that’s true to you.
A definition built not on pressure, perfection, or productivity — but on purpose, peace, and presence.
What if success wasn’t something to push for — but something to calibrate? Join me, your host Anna Kitney and special guest Sabinije von Gaffke for a powerful exploration of leadership, coherence, and sustainable success.
Sabinije von Gaffke works with a simple but profound question: How do we succeed, lead, and evolve without abandoning ourselves along the way?
Sabinije will guide participants through CALIBRATION™️ — her newly introduced framework for redefining success through coherence, embodiment, and sustainable leadership, offering both conceptual insight and an embodied experience.
​Anna will guide you through the SoulAlign® Heal method to:
​✅ Let go of outdated versions of success that leave you spinning
✅ Tune into your own soul values, not society’s expectations
✅ Clarify what fulfilment truly feels like in your body and nervous system
✅ Activate a peaceful, grounded inner state you can return to daily
✅ Anchor a new success standard — one that lasts
​You’ll Walk Away With:

​A personal, soul-aligned definition of success that finally feels like yours — not what the world told you it should be.
No more chasing. No more performing. Just deep clarity on what truly matters to you.

​A body-reset that releases the pressure of constant achievement.
You’ll experience what success feels like when it’s calm, grounded, and sustainable.

​Clarity around the goals, timelines, and expectations you’re ready to let go of — and the ones that are truly aligned.
You’ll leave knowing what to stop striving for, and what to start honouring. You’ll create goals with soul.

​An embodied sense of fulfilment you can access anytime — without needing to “achieve” anything.
Success becomes a state, not a finish line.

​A renewed connection to purpose, peace, and presence — so your next chapter is built on truth, not templates.
This becomes your new foundation for business, relationships, and life.

​Why This Event Matters
​We’ve all been taught that success is a destination:
The money. The milestone. The title. The house.
​But true success — the kind that lasts — is an internal state.
​It comes from alignment to your most important values.
From a deeper and heartfelt meaning.
From a feeling of being on path with your divine purpose.
​This live meditation experience is your moment to reclaim that path — and step back into your own rhythm.
​You don’t need to chase success.
​You only need to remember what it means to you.
​Join us for a powerful morning of reflection, recalibration, and redefinition — so you can create from a place of fulfilment, not pressure.
​You’ll leave not just clearer — but lighter, more grounded, and fully connected to what matters most.

The Art of Coaching Redefined: Become the Spiritual Mentor Coach.
The SoulAlign® Coach program will become the new Gold Standard of coaching. A fusion of energy work, coaching, mentorship and spiritual practices.
For the first time I will be peeling back the curtain, and sharing my rapid transformational framework that’s being responsible for over **$150M+** client combined revenues.
Learn how to create rapid results in just one 30 mins session!
I’m the dark horse of the coaching industry.
You don’t need expertise in the clients industry. You don’t need to have earned more than them and you don’t need to execute their strategy yourself.
I’ve being quietly supporting female business owners to thrive, in any economy. Breaking the rules of *traditional* business. Unashamedly utilising woo-woo to generate over **$100M+** in combined client revenues.
I’ve coach clientele from song artists, to investors, former olympic athletes, to Theta Healers® and spiritual teachers across the world.
The moment I fused energy healing with coaching, my clients began to have accelerated results that defied logic.
The two worked synergistically which allowed my clients to move forward with confidence and certainty.
Healing focuses on releasing the past. To release wounds, traumas and self limiting beliefs. It’s design to collapse old energetic patterns which keep recurring in your life. Often stemming from childhood, ancestors. past lives and collective consciousness.
Coaching focuses on what you are creating in the future through releasing the resistance to your clearly defined desire. Through a series of tools and process it gets you into aligned action. Which in turn creates results.
But, I took my work step even further.
After feeling the frustration of asking open ended questions to allow my client to discover their own solutions in traditional coaching practice, I began fusing mentorship.
A mentor is someone who shares their knowledge, skills and/or experience, to help another to develop and grow.
Mentorship allowed me to simply share my personal experience, my lifetime of lessons and my expertise from a broad range of industries and working with countless world class coaches and mentors over the last 20 years, and simply pass on that knowledge to collapse time for my clients.


You’re in the right place if…
You’ve been over-giving for far too long.
You’re trying to fix your clients. You’re stuck in the role of the “rescuer,” thinking that if you just work harder, they’ll get the results. But deep down, you know this isn’t sustainable.
Here’s the truth:
Your clients don’t need fixing. They need leadership.
When you hold the vision of their highest potential—when you believe in their power—you empower them to create their own breakthroughs. And that’s where real transformation happens.
What you assume about your clients—your belief in their potential—directly impacts their results. When you expect greatness from them and hold the vision of their highest potential, they rise to meet it.
Here’s why this is crucial for your business:
👉 You stop over-giving and step into your role as a leader, not a fixer.
👉 You attract premium clients who are ready to invest in themselves (and in you).
👉 Your clients achieve better results because they are empowered to take responsibility for their own success.
When you shift your mindset and lead from a place of belief in your clients’ capabilities, you’ll see the ripple effect in your business:
Higher client satisfaction and retention.
Stronger, soul-aligned connections with those you serve.
Increased income as you confidently charge premium rates.


Get paid premium rates for your gifts.
The power of intuitive coaching to get clients into soul-aligned action, instead of endless hustle.
The Coaching Industry is a multi-billion dollar industry. The online space has made it easy to have international clientele, working from anywhere in the world with more time freedom. Coaching is a highly valued, credible and respected profession where you can charge premium rates as standard.
Whether you have never coached before, or wish to add coaching into your existing toolkit, this methodology will propel your business and create rapid results for your clients.
It was never about doing more. Through the art of asking powerful questions, you can guide a client to uncover the right strategies and actions for them. To discover the needle movers in their lives that creates momentum and quantum leaps.
Because the soul always knows.


*THE SPIRITUAL MENTOR COACH*

Become the sought after expert that others seek out.
This is for serious action takers who are ready to uplevel their life and bring a powerful process to your clients.
You will ascend in your spiritual, personal and professional life. To become a world class coach, you will also grow; session-by-session, client-by-client.
By choosing this dharma or life purpose, you’re contributing to the ripple effect of elevating human consciousness. People don’t accidentally find me. They are called by a higher power.
I was born to coach, mentor and teach.
I am the torch bearer of ancient knowledge in a modern world.
I invite you to light your spark and blaze boldly through this life to make it extraordinary, fulfilling your great purpose.
