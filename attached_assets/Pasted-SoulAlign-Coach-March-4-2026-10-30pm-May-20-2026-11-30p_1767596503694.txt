The Art of Coaching Redefined: Become the Spiritual Mentor Coach.
The SoulAlign® Coach program will become the new Gold Standard of coaching. A fusion of energy work, coaching, mentorship and spiritual practices.
For the first time I will be peeling back the curtain, and sharing my rapid transformational framework that’s being responsible for over $150M+ client combined revenues.
Learn how to create rapid results in just one 30 mins session! 
I’m the dark horse of the coaching industry.
You don’t need expertise in the clients industry. You don’t need to have earned more than them and you don’t need to execute their strategy yourself. 
I’ve being quietly supporting female business owners to thrive, in any economy. Breaking the rules of *traditional* business. Unashamedly utilising woo-woo to generate over $100M+ in combined client revenues.
I’ve coach clientele from song artists, to investors, former olympic athletes, to Theta Healers® and spiritual teachers across the world. 
The moment I fused energy healing with coaching, my clients began to have accelerated results that defied logic.
The two worked synergistically which allowed my clients to move forward with confidence and certainty. 
Healing focuses on releasing the past. To release wounds, traumas and self limiting beliefs. It’s design to collapse old energetic patterns which keep recurring in your life. Often stemming from childhood, ancestors. past lives and collective consciousness. 
Coaching focuses on what you are creating in the future through releasing the resistance to your clearly defined desire. Through a series of tools and process it gets you into aligned action. Which in turn creates results. 
But, I took my work step even further. 
After feeling the frustration of asking open ended questions to allow my client to discover their own solutions in traditional coaching practice, I began fusing mentorship. 
A mentor is someone who shares their knowledge, skills and/or experience, to help another to develop and grow. 
Mentorship allowed me to simply share my personal experience, my lifetime of lessons and my expertise from a broad range of industries and working with countless world class coaches and mentors over the last 20 years, and simply pass on that knowledge to collapse time for my clients. 

 
You’re in the right place if…
You’ve been over-giving for far too long. 
You’re trying to fix your clients. You’re stuck in the role of the “rescuer,” thinking that if you just work harder, they’ll get the results. But deep down, you know this isn’t sustainable. 
Here’s the truth:
Your clients don’t need fixing. They need leadership. 
When you hold the vision of their highest potential—when you believe in their power—you empower them to create their own breakthroughs. And that’s where real transformation happens. 
What you assume about your clients—your belief in their potential—directly impacts their results. When you expect greatness from them and hold the vision of their highest potential, they rise to meet it. 
Here’s why this is crucial for your business:
👉 You stop over-giving and step into your role as a leader, not a fixer.
👉 You attract premium clients who are ready to invest in themselves (and in you).
👉 Your clients achieve better results because they are empowered to take responsibility for their own success. 
When you shift your mindset and lead from a place of belief in your clients’ capabilities, you’ll see the ripple effect in your business: 
Higher client satisfaction and retention.
Stronger, soul-aligned connections with those you serve.
Increased income as you confidently charge premium rates. 

 
Get paid premium rates for your gifts.
The power of intuitive coaching to get clients into soul-aligned action, instead of endless hustle. 
The Coaching Industry is a multi-billion dollar industry. The online space has made it easy to have international clientele, working from anywhere in the world with more time freedom. Coaching is a highly valued, credible and respected profession where you can charge premium rates as standard. 
Whether you have never coached before, or wish to add coaching into your existing toolkit, this methodology will propel your business and create rapid results for your clients. 
It was never about doing more. Through the art of asking powerful questions, you can guide a client to uncover the right strategies and actions for them. To discover the needle movers in their lives that creates momentum and quantum leaps. 
Because the soul always knows.
