SoulAlign Heal. 3RD JUNE – 30TH SEPT 2026 | 5 – 6:30 PM (BST)

The energetic gateway where you stop healing the human avatar and start transmitting as the Divine.

*THIS IS THE SHIFT FROM 3D SURVIVAL AND WOUNDED IDENTITY INTO 5D CREATION AS THE I AM CONSCIOUSNESS—WHERE YOUR ENERGETIC FIELD NO LONGER MIRRORS YOUR PAST, BUT REFLECTS YOUR POWER.*

SoulAlign® Heal is a multidimensional recalibration experience for the women and men who are ready to exit the healing loop and step into her God Consciousness. This is not about fixing what was never broken. It’s a radical shift from “healing the body” to remembering that you are not the body — you are the frequency broadcasting through it.
SoulAlign® Heal works by dissolving the programs of identity that keep you entangled in trauma patterns, endless earth-bound karmic loops, and polarity swings. You stop circling through the first three levels of consciousness — to-me consciousness (survival & victim), by-me (human effort and force), and through-me (the spiritual channel of the God outside of yourself) — and stabilise in the fourth level: As-me-God Consciousness (The I AM presence within you). This is the path of differentiated divinity, where you reclaim your power as the conscious Creator and release the need to dig, fix, or heal endlessly.

the expulsion from the GARDEN OF EDEN
The expulsion from the Garden of Eden was never a punishment—it was the moment of individuation, the awakening of the soul to its own agency. It marked the end of innocence and the beginning of human sovereignty: the capacity to discern right from wrong, to navigate the dense terrain of ego, duality, and time. This descent into form was an initiation into the mastery of the Avatar—the bio-suit—and the opportunity to remember our divine nature through contrast.
SoulAlign® Heal is the return journey: not a regression into naivety, but a sovereign reactivation of God Consciousness. It is a return to Love, to Source, to the knowing that we are not separate, broken, or in need of repair. We are the infinite—whole, timeless, and complete—simply learning to wield our divinity inside the holographic illusion of form. This is Eden restored—not as a place, but as a state of frequency. Then we can truly create heaven on earth.


you’re tired of…
‘almost, but never fully healed’
You were told that the human body—your Avatar—holds the keys to your breakthrough. So you dig deeper, journal harder, cry more often, and call it catharsis. There is always one more past life to heal. One more self limiting belief to remove. One more ancestral trauma to clear. And the endless karmic loop on earth! Did you ever question that you had more lives than just human earth ones?

*BUT HERE’S THE TRUTH NO ONE TOLD YOU:*

The body isn’t the cause. It’s the effect. And the more you obsess over fixing the symptoms—trauma, triggers, nervous system dysregulation—the more you reinforce the identity of someone who is still broken! That’s the problem paradigm. It keeps you chasing the next “root cause”, trapped in the illusion that healing is your life’s work. But healing is a bridge—not a destination.
Far too many people have spiritualised their suffering. They’ve made healing their identity. They confuse emotional purging for evolution. They stay stuck in endless loops of subconscious rewiring, nervous system regulation, and shadow work… all while their actual life, leadership, and legacy remain on pause. Some even find comfort in it. Healing becomes a form of entertainment. A cycle of temporary highs, rituals, and spiritual cosplay—while nothing truly changes.

*SOULALIGN® HEAL IS HERE TO COLLAPSE THAT LOOP.*

To end the performance and initiate you into embodied power. Not as a wounded Avatar, but as Source itself—broadcasting wholeness into the unified field.
This teaching has being around for thousands of years. The Kybalion book spoke of it, in ancient hermetic principles in 200 BC. Paramahansa Yogananda wrote of it in 1958. Neville Goddard spoke of it in 1939. This awareness has existed in many ‘new thought’ movements and healing circles. This is a remembering.


at first, I was enchanted,
crystals, cacao ceremonies, full moon circles, manifestations.
It felt like I’d found my soul family. A community speaking in vibration, alignment, and truth. But the deeper I went, the more I saw behind the veil.
Everyone was manifesting, but no one was creating. Everyone talked about abundance, but no one actually had money. Everyone was healing, but no one was changing. Underneath the pretty language was a deep victimhood. A refusal to take ownership, masked as “alignment.” Avoidance packaged as “feminine flow.” Emotional purging mistaken for evolution. It became spiritual entertainment—performing consciousness while avoiding power. I realised the obsession with healing was keeping people safe from ever stepping into real impact. So I stopped playing this game of the matrix.
Because true spirituality isn’t performance—it’s power. It’s building when it’s hard. Creating when it’s inconvenient. Choosing devotion over comfort. Breathwork didn’t build my business. Discipline did. The most spiritual thing I’ve ever done is show up as my highest version now, lead, and build the vision. That’s the ceremony now.


my awakening from the matrix
You may have built your entire career and business on healing and coaching your clients by digging up the past and working through childhood wounds. You may be questioning it all now, just as I did. I still believe healing has it’s place. I’m not seeking to destroy it, but to evolve it. I still love my crystals, angel cards, numerology, mindset work and journaling. BUT… I’m not giving my power away to these things in order to receive.

*YOU CAN’T ‘GOOD GIRL’ YOUR WAY TO MILLIONS. GOD NEVER QUESTIONED YOUR WORTHINESS, YOU DID. AND NO MATTER HAS MANY TIMES YOU AFFIRM THAT YOU ARE A LION, YOU WILL ALWAYS BE THE HUMAN.*

SoulAlign® Heal is for the souls who are ready to evolve from the first three levels of consciousness into the forth – the I AM Presence. Otherwise known as Christ or Buddhic Consciousness. The state that people like Eckhart Tolle, Michael B. Beckwith, Paramahansa Yogananda and Michael Alan Singer wrote of in their books.
The Godzone is a state of true oneness with everything. That you are NOT your job, your gender, your ego, or your body. You are a spiritual being living in a body. You are God Consciousness, you are the raindrop in the ocean. When your physical body in the 3D dies, that drop will return to the infinite ocean. But the essence of you remains eternal and immortal.
The Avatar vs. The Source-Fractal
Your avatar is your human identity: your name, trauma, patterns, nervous system responses, and belief systems. It’s the programmed self trying to earn love, prove value, and hustle for safety. Your Source-Fractal is the divine spark within you. It is the true Self beyond story. It doesn’t heal to become worthy. It simply remembers that it always was.
When you manifest from your avatar, you manifest from lack potential. You manifest because you need. You effort. You grip. You chase. When you manifest from your Source Fractal, you manifest from abundance potential. You manifest because you are. You expand. You trust. You allow.

*AND HERE’S WHAT NO ONE TEACHES:*

→ You can’t “mindset” your way into a new life if your energetic grid is still coded with fear, unworthiness, or scarcity.
→ You can’t “vision board” your way there if your dominant vibration is leaking through old identity loops.
→ You can’t force results with “massive action” that only respond to one thing — who you are being energetically.

The matrix is not just a metaphor. It
